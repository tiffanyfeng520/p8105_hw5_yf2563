## Problem 1

#### 1.1.1

Describe the raw data. Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore,
MD”)

#### 1.1.2

Summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the
number of unsolved homicides

#### 1.2.1

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate
the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of
prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull
the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting
tidy dataframe.

#### 1.3

Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract
both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval
for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map,
purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy
dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

#### 1.4

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out
geom\_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower
limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved
homicides.
